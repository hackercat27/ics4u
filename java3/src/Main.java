/*
 * Create a Program that:
 *
 * Stores ten 4-letter words that you have pre-set in an array (do not print these words out to the user)
 * Randomly choose ONE of the words in the array to be the “secret word”
 * Create two methods: startsWith(char a) and an endsWith(char b) that will check to see whether the String randomly chosen out of the array starts or ends with specified letters.
 *         **Refer to some of the methods that already exist in the String class as they may be helpful - Java Library
 * Create a method that determines whether or not they have correctly guessed the “secret word”
 *
 * Interact with a user so that they can type in values. You will want to prompt your user to do the following:
 *
 * Choose to play your game (once you’ve explained how the game works)
 *
 * Ask if they would like to do one of the following:
 *
 * Determine the starting letter
 * Determine the ending letter
 * Guess the word
 * Exit the game (once they’ve guessed the word correctly, or no longer want to play)
 *
