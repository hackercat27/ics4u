/*
 * Coding Task: Create a program in order to complete as many of the following tasks as you can:
 * Within the main method:
 * Print out each array using the Arrays.toString(int [] arr) method. (remember youâ€™ll need to import Arrays)
 * Print out information by accessing each method and print out information.
 * OUTSIDE of the main method, create methods that:
 *  - Create a method that:
 *       - Randomly generates a number between 1-10 (which will be used to set the size of the array)
 *       - Create an int array. Initialize the array to be the size of the random number between 1-10 that you just created.
 *       - Randomly generate numbers between 10-20 and fill the array with these random numbers (Adjust the added value to our random number generator as modelled in Java 2C).
 *  - Return true if the array has between 5-10 terms
 *  - Return true if the first number is the smallest in the array (do you understand how to adjust your for loop?)
 *  - Return true if the last number is the largest in the array (do you understand how to adjust your for loop?)
 *  - Return the product of the first two values in the array
